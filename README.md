# An animated submit button

A small and quiet simple animation on a submit button. I had this idea watching a video from WDS.

## View & Inspect

If you want to see the animation, you can always do the following:

```bash
# Clone the repo
gh repo clone MartinHeywang/submit-button-animation

# Serve the folder on localhost
serve -s submit-button-animation
```
